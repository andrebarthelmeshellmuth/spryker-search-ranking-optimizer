# Contributing to search-ranking-optimizer

Thanks for considering a contribution — issues and PRs are welcome. This is a single-maintainer
open-source project, so response times may vary.

## Getting started

```
composer install
```

Requires PHP 8.3+ (CI also runs against 8.4). This package is a Spryker module: several of its
classes only make sense wired into a real Spryker shop (Zed layer, Propel-backed persistence,
Elasticsearch/OpenSearch `rank_eval`). If you're working on a change that needs to be exercised
end-to-end, you'll need a Spryker demo shop with this package (and its
[search-ranking](https://github.com/andrebarthelmeshellmuth/spryker-search-ranking) dependency)
installed as local path repositories — see the README's Installation section.

## Before opening a PR

These are the checks CI runs; running them locally first saves a review round-trip:

```
composer validate --no-check-publish
vendor/bin/phpcs
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -c phpstan.neon src/
vendor/bin/phpmd src text phpmd.xml
vendor/bin/phpmd src text phpmd-public-methods.xml
composer rector-dry-run
composer check-floors
```

`check-floors` re-resolves dependencies to the lowest versions allowed by `composer.json` and
asserts every vendor symbol used in `src/` still exists at that floor — it's the check most likely
to catch an accidental "works on my shop" dependency bump.

The functional test suite (`tests/SprykerCommunityTest`) is Codeception-based and needs a running
Spryker shop (MySQL + Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) to execute; it isn't runnable via `composer install`
alone. If you can't spin one up, open the PR anyway — CI covers style/static-analysis/dependency-floor
checks, and the functional suite will be run before merging.

## Making a change

- Keep PRs focused — one change per PR.
- Branch from and target `main`; branches are merged via squash, so intermediate commit messages
  don't need to be polished.
- Match the existing code style — `phpcs` and `rector-dry-run` above catch most deviations.
- If a change touches the optimization algorithms themselves rather than how they're driven from
  Zed, it likely belongs in
  [blackbox-optimizer](https://github.com/andrebarthelmeshellmuth/blackbox-optimizer) instead —
  see that repo's own CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Update `README.md`/`docs/` when behavior changes.

## Reporting bugs or requesting features

Use the issue templates — they ask for the information needed to reproduce a bug or evaluate a
request. For security issues, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead of opening a public issue.
